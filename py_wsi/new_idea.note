CHANGE


Make a separate LMDB for every WSI.

case_no_image_name_lmdb
case_no_image_name_lmdb_meta

For example:

Case_00001_101528_lmdb
Case_00001_101528_lmdb_meta

This way the database size is known and better able to be estimated.

TRANSACTIONS

Every row of patches from the WSI will be read and the patches saved as a single transaction.
The map_size will be calculated using the x and y tile dimensions (number of patches per image) to minimise wasted space.
